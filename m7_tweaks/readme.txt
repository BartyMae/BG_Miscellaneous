		Section I. About
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a (for now, small) collection of convenience tweaks, cheats and fixes.
It makes a few things slightly more convenient than they were in the original
game, particularly if you are playing for the 100th time.

See Section III for the list of available components.


		Section II. Installation
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BGII is required. ToB is required for many components, optional for the others.
I have tested this with a hefty collection of mods stacked on top of each other,
so you should be safe in most scenarios.

Unzip the main ZIP file into your BGII main directory. This is normally:
        C:\Program Files\Black Isle\BGII - SoA\

Run (click on) "setup-m7_tweaks.exe". 

First, pick your favorite language. Currently available: 
  American English 

Then choose which components you would like to install. You may always
uninstall them later by re-running "setup-m7_tweaks.exe". 

As a rule, you do *not* need to start a new game to take advantage of anything
you installed; exceptions are noted in the component descriptions.


		Section III. Components
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    1. Convenient Deck of Many Things: Always win against Aesgareth
---------------------------------------------------------------
As the name implies, Aesgareth is changed so that he always loses against you in
the 3 draws. This results in him attacking at the end when he loses the gem, so
be warned.

    2. Convenient/Cheesy/Cheating Deck of Many Things
    -------------------------------------------------
This is aimed at reducing the number of reloads until you get what you want from
the deck. This component is subdivided into four subcomponents; all of these
subcomponents have one modification in common: they make the 'Star' card more
convenient and flexible. By this I mean: you get an expanded stat selection,
which takes into account all of a classes 'prime requisite' attributes (Paladins
can increase Charisma, for example) from 2nd edition AD&D, as well as allowing
which stat bonus you get -- a multiclass Fighter/Mage/Thief can elect to gain a
Strength bonus, for example, instead of gaining a Dexterity increase.

The subcomponents have the following additional effects:

  2a. Convenient: Select from normal available choices in each draw
You can select which card you will receive in this draw. The only difference
from the original game is that you no longer have to reload until you get the
card you want :-)

  2b. Convenient Plus: As above, but ignore 'Bad Card' restrictions
Normally, the second and third draws have different selections if you draw a
'bad' card (e.g., Donjon) in an earlier draw. This component works as 2a, but
it lifts this restriction.

  2c. Cheesy: All cards can be selected in any of the 3 draws
This component combines all cards you could possibly get from the deck into a
single list shown in each of the 3 draws you get. For example, you could select
'Star' 3 times for the stat bonuses.

  2d. Cheating: As the cheesy version, but with infinite draws
As the title implies. 'Balance' card is also added as a choice for when you get
tired of ruining the game :-)

    3. Convenient/Cheating Machine of Lum the Mad
    ---------------------------------------------
This component eliminates the need to remember and select the combinations for
the Machine of Lum the Mad. This component is subdivided into two subcomponents,
all of which have the side-effect of disabling random combinations.

The subcomponents have the following additional effects:

  3a. Convenient: You can simply select the desired result
Pick from the descriptive list and you are done. This obbeys all of the standard
restrictions -- that is, each combination can be selected only once.

  3b. Cheating: As above, but with infinite stat bonuses
As 3a, but you can select the stat bonuses and magic resistance bonus until you
suck all the fun from the game.


    4. Fix uncharming of Glaicas (De'Arnise Hold)
    ---------------------------------------------
This allows Glaicas to be properly saved without recourse to luck. Cast your
strongest charm spell and he will be correctly uncharmed.


		Section IV. Known Bugs
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Glaicas component may result in him attacking (or being attacked) after the
charm is dispelled. This can be avoided by disabling party AI when confronting
him.

You can't select a random combination anymore in the Machine of Lum the Mad.
